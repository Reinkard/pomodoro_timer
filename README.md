üïê The Pomodoro Technique program
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method based on 25-minute stretches of focused work broken by five-minute breaks. Longer breaks, typically 15 to 30 minutes, are taken after four consecutive work intervals. Each work interval is called a pomodoro, the Italian word for tomato (plural: pomodori).

Developing the program, I used the `tkinter` library, `Label()`, `Button()`, `Canvas()` widgets

To run enter on your terminal:
```Python
python3 main.py
```
